I completed my PhD at [Johns Hopkins University](https://www.jhu.edu/) under the wonderful supervision of both [Matthew Green](https://isi.jhu.edu/~mgreen/) and [Abhishek Jain](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~abhishek/). One of the key focuses of my dissertation work was the security and construction of efficient SNARKs and proof systems, particularly those involving error-correcting codes. I was a recipient of an EF [academic grant](https://blog.ethereum.org/2023/06/28/academic-grants-round-23) that funded our work on SNARK security.

I co-founded [Eternis](https://www.eternis.ai/) where we're building privacy-preserving personal AI and more. Due to this, my recent research focus has shifted to understanding and improving LLMs, particularly using reinforcement learning and other LLM post-training techniques. First in this line of work is [this](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14094) paper on annotation-efficient GRPO post-training.
