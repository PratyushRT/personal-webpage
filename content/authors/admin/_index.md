I am a first year PhD student at [Johns Hopkins University](https://www.jhu.edu/) under the wonderful supervision of both [Abhishek Jain](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~abhishek/) and [Matt Green](https://isi.jhu.edu/~mgreen/). I am in general interested in cryptography and its applications, more specifically, verifiable computation, cryptography in the presence of quantum computers and privacy-preserving techniques. I am particularly interested in designing protocols with minimal trust requirements.
