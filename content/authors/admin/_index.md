I am a second year PhD student at [Johns Hopkins University](https://www.jhu.edu/) under the wonderful supervision of both [Abhishek Jain](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~abhishek/) and [Matt Green](https://isi.jhu.edu/~mgreen/). I am in general interested in cryptography and its applications, more specifically, most of my research interests are at the intersection of cryptography with privacy, quantum computation and verifiable computation. I am particularly interested in designing protocols with minimal trust requirements. This summer I am also collaborating with the Ethereum Research team to build, attack and study practical [verifiable delay functions (VDFs)](https://vdfresearch.org/).
