abstract: "In this paper, we put forth the problem of bequeathing cryptoassets. In this problem, a testator wishes to bequeath cryptoassets - e.g. secrets, static keys or cryptocurrency - to their heirs. Crucially, the testator should retain control of their assets before their passing. Additionally testator needs to maintain privacy, i.e. beneficiaries must not learn the bequest, moreover, beneficiaries must not be able to determine whether they will inherit at all before testator's decease. We formally define the security goals of a cryptographic will (cryptowill) protocol and subsequently present schemes fulfilling the required security properties."
