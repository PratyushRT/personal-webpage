abstract: "We present a VDF protocol that incorporate challenging requirements from the Ethereum ecosystem, which includes low-latency proof generation and VDF hardware that is both inexpensive and secure in post-quantum settings. Our protocol utilizes an aggressively optimized iterative algebraic transformation combined with the recent proof aggregation technique enabling the proof latency overhead of only a few minutes over the primary computation. The protocol is currently undergoing final scrutiny before entering the production stage at Ethereum 2.0."
